Car collision or car accident one of the collision type in Road accidents. According to Corrigan [1], despite collecting large quantities traffic data, Transportation Departments of all levels are unable to use such data to good effect. Founded in 2015, a start-up called ODN could predict when and where accidents are most likely to bappen. Officials could use such information to direct safety efforts at the stretch of road were the impacts could be the biggest. In the context of this research, some of the developed countries like US, UK government could use the information generated from a prediction system with a Neural Network predicting the accident severity and use this information to enhance the laws to build s√§ierAon a torture. in ans project Eire dealing with the all the saler possible ways to reach the destination by overcoming car accident servery with the different critical traffic conditions on the way to journey. By prediction car accident servity improve the traffic safety measures. And implements the traffic rules accordingly by governments Better servity conditions.
